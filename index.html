    <h style="color:blue;">First week</h>
    <p>The first week at AkiraChix was good.It was somehow challanging
        because we are students from diffrent countries.It was grateful 
        meeting together and ready to learn.The institution were able 
        to take us through the Safe guiding policy so that we know what
        we are going to do for the entire 10 months.They also trained 
        us what to do incase of fire accident,that is Fire Awereness 
        training.During the training they also taught us of 
        using the appropriate Fire extinguisher while extinguishing
        fire.
